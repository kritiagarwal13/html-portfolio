<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Kriti Agarwal. I live in Dublin, Ireland. I am an iOS developer and have recently started learning Web Development.</p>

<p>I've always been interested in the technology and how it's advancing every second. Since childhood, I've always been fascinated with how things work on the otherside of the screen. Connecting with the world has been a game changer.</p>

<p>As a 90s kid, I've seen the evolution of technology. From keypad phones, to smartphones. From maintaing a contact book to Facebook, and what not. We've come very far and it's mind blowing. I desire to learn more about the tech advancements and keep moving with the change in time.</p>
